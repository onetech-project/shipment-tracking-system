// Surfaces chwt_awb (raw chargeable weight from the booking) in v_pnl_to for the AWB drilldown.
// Kept as a separate, forward-only migration (not folded into 20260615000001) because that one had
// already been applied to environments — editing it would not re-run. This only rebuilds the
// materialized view; it does NOT touch the actuals data columns, so settled rows are preserved.
//
// chwt is per-AWB constant (booking is one row per AWB); the AWB drilldown reads MAX(chwt_awb) and
// the per-TO breakdown allocates it by weight_share. Body mirrors 20260615000001 with the actuals +
// basis columns always present, and chwt_awb gated by `withChwt`.
